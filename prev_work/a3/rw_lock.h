// DEFINITIONS

// The structure definition of a readers-writers lock.
typedef struct rw_lock {
  // To protect internal state.
  pthread_mutex_t mutex_;
  // To notify about changes in state.
  pthread_cond_t cv_;

  // The number of active readers.
  int num_readers_;
  // The number of active readers (should only ever be 0 or 1).
  int num_writers_;
  // The number of waiting writers, needed to prevent writer starvation.
  int num_waiting_writers_;

// The reader-writer lock can be held in one of two modes: as a reader, or as
// a writer. This enum defines the mode that the lock is held.
typedef enum rw_lock_mode { RW_READ_LOCK, RW_WRITE_LOCK } rw_lock_mode_t;

// You can initialize a static lock using this macro. For example:
// rw_lock_t lock = RW_LOCK_INITIALIZER;
#define RW_LOCK_INITIALIZER \
  { PTHREAD_MUTEX_INITIALIZER, PTHREAD_COND_INITIALIZER, 0, 0, 0 }

// FUNCTIONS
// All functions return 0 on success or an error number to indicate the error.

// Initialize the lock, this must be called prior to all future calls on the
// lock.

// Destroy the lock, this must be called when you are finished with the lock.

// Acquire the lock in mode  (RW_READ_LOCK, RW_WRITE_LOCK).

// Release the lock from mode  (RW_READ_LOCK, RW_WRITE_LOCK). To release the lock
// you must have been an owner of the lock.
